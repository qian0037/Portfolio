# Portfolio

# Process
I embarked on the journey of designing my portfolio website by crafting moodboards and creating primary and tertiary personas, as part of my User Experience class assignment. This approach proved invaluable in ensuring a clear understanding of my website's target audience, facilitating the design process to cater not only to my preferences but also to the needs of my visitors. Opting for a concept of "modern, simplistic, and refreshing," I aimed for a minimalistic branding that resonated with my design choice.  The next step involved translating these ideas into tangible form, starting with lofi-wireframes that provided a foundational blueprint for this project. I then developed high-fi wireframes and engaged in an in-class focus group session with four of my classmates. The insights, critiques, and suggestions from both my professor and classmates significantly contributed to refining my interactive prototype. As a result, my current portfolio website closely mirrors the final version of my interactive prototype.
# Challenges
During the development of my portfolio website, I encountered a series of intricate challenges that demanded both technical prowess and creative problem-solving. 
I initially faced challenges while adjusting the background color of the navigation bar, which led to a period of stress. However, I discovered a surprisingly simple solution: by removing the "bg-light" class and introducing the "navbar-color" class in my CSS, I was able to apply my preferred color and resolve the issue. Another hurdle emerged when my hamburger menu failed to function correctly. Concerned that I had potentially misspelled or accidentally deleted crucial code, I did quite a bit research by watching YouTube videos and the question-and-answer sections on Codeacademy. Eventually, I realized that I needed to include the Bootstrap JavaScript CDN alongside my CSS to make the menu work as intended. Additionally, I faced difficulties while customizing a carousel slideshow, particularly with unresponsive buttons. Upon investigation, I noticed that I had accidently copied code from an older Bootstrap version (4.0), while my project is based on version 5.3.1. Furthermore, I had overlooked the need to modify the "data-target" attribute to "data-bs-target" to match my newer version. 
# What I learned
Coding was never my strong suit, and it was easy for me to get frustrated when I encountered all kinds of issues. I believe there's a lot of room for improvement in my coding skills, and I'm determined to enhance them. Building my portfolio website has been a precious experience that taught me the importance of meticulous attention to detail and the value of cross-referencing resources, ultimately enhancing my proficiency in web development. I was truly amazed by how powerful the Bootstrap library is and realized that I have only scratched the surface of understanding its intricacies. I am eagerly looking forward to delving into these online open-source frameworks to broaden my knowledge and skills.
